# This Makefile is used to define the user defined variables local to each project.
# Use different file for each os or release of the os for wich different values of flags are required.

# Define each variable with the cpp flags values required for the corresponding library,
# then set the final flag variables (OCFLAGS_PROJ and LINK_FLAGS_PROJ) with the defined library variables.
# Do not change the name of the variables defined for each different library, being they used also in the makefile of the corresponding libraries
